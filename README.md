Here is a **README.md** file for your **Product Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning** project based on the provided dataset and code.  
## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to **forecast product sales** using machine learning models. By analyzing historical sales data and different influencing factors (advertising spend, promotions, customer segmentation, etc.), businesses can **optimize marketing strategies** and improve sales growth.  

---

## **Objectives**  
**Predict future product sales** using historical data.  
**Analyze the impact of various factors** such as advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation.  
**Handle missing values, detect outliers, and apply feature scaling** for optimal model performance.  
**Train and compare different ML models** to find the best-performing one.  
**Evaluate models using statistical techniques** such as RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score.  
**Provide business insights** for decision-making and marketing optimization.  

---

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset includes customer and sales information with the following features:  
- **Gender**  
- **Age**  
- **Annual Salary**  
- **Credit Card Debt**  
- **Net Worth**  
- **Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable)**  

---

## **Approach & Methodology**  
### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Drop unnecessary columns** (Customer Name, Email, Country).  
- **Handle missing values** (drop or impute).  
- **Detect and remove outliers** using boxplots and Z-score analysis.  
- **Feature scaling** (StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler).  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualizing correlations with **heatmaps** and **pairplots**.  
- Identifying trends and patterns.  

### **3. Feature Engineering**  
- Creating new predictive features.  
- Encoding categorical variables.  

### **4. Model Selection & Training**  
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost 
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.  

### **5. Model Evaluation**  
- Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ Score.  

---

## **Model Evaluation**  
üìå Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ‚Äì Measures the average prediction error.  
üìå Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ‚Äì Represents the absolute average prediction error.  
üìå R¬≤ Score ‚Äì Determines how well the model explains variance in sales data.
